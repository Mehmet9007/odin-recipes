    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Manti</strong> is a type of dumpling mainly found in Turkish cuisine, 
        Armenian cuisine and Central Asian cuisine but also in West Asia, South Caucasus, 
        and the Balkans. Manti is also popular among Chinese Muslims, 
        and it is consumed throughout post-Soviet countries,
        where the dish spread from the Central Asian republics.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dumplings typically consist of a spiced meat mixture, usually lamb or ground beef, 
        wrapped in a thin dough sheet which is then boiled or steamed. 
        The size and shape of manti vary significantly depending on geographic location.

    <h2>Steps</h2>

            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
                Make dough: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Add eggs and water, 
                mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. 
                Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">
            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
                Make filling: Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; 
                drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper 
                in a medium bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">
            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
                Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">
            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
                Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, 
                roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle as thin as possible. 
                Cut into 2-inch squares using a knife or pastry wheel.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">
            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
                Place about 2 teaspoons filling in the center of each square. 
                Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. 
                Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">
            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
                Make oil: Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat 
                just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">
            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
                Make sauce: Stir together yogurt and garlic in a small bowl; set aside.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">
            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. 
                Cook manti in boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is tender, 
                20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.
            </span>
        </li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">
            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
                Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle with pepper oil.
