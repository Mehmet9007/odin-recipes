    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>İskender kebap</strong> is a Turkish dish that consists of sliced meat topped with 
        hot tomato sauce over pieces of pita bread, and generously slathered with 
        melted special sheep's milk butter and yogurt. 
        It can be prepared from thinly cut grilled lamb or chicken.
    </p>
    <p>
        The prepared kebab is placed at a distance of 10-15 cm (3.9-5.9 in) from 
        the previously lit fire and is cooked slowly, then it is cut thinly with 
        a knife from top to bottom and is then served. 
        Tomato sauce and melted butter are generally poured over the dish at the table, 
        for the customer's amusement.

            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Arrange pita bread on a baking sheet.

        </li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">
            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
                Bake pitas in the preheated oven until lightly toasted; 
                cut into bite-sized pieces and keep warm.
            </span>           
        </li>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">
            <span style="font-weight: normal;">
                Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in chicken, onion, and garlic; 
                cook until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear, about 10 minutes. 
                Mix in tomato purée; season with cumin, salt, and pepper. 
                Continue to cook and stir for a few minutes.
